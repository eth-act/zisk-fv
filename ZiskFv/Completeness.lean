# Completeness — blueprint

Read top to bottom; the whole point is to make "the eventual theorem" and "what
we currently assume" each a single named object.

* `OutstandingZiskPredicates` — ZisK's production decode/lower/circuit surface as abstract
  predicates on a raw word. Placeholders for the *real* ZisK predicates, which
  live in the Aeneas-extracted world this build cannot import.
* `OutstandingZiskPredicates.Covers raw` — what "ZisK fully handles `raw`" means: the whole
  pipeline succeeds and the soundness-row contract holds.
* `EventualCompleteness state z` — **THE GOAL.** Every Sail-executable RV64IM word
  outside the known decode gaps is covered by ZisK. This is what we want
  *unconditionally*.
* `OutstandingZiskPredicates.CoverageAssumptions z` — **WHAT WE CURRENTLY ASSUME.** One field per
  pipeline stage; each field is a plan item the Aeneas harness must discharge.
* `sail_executable_within_supported_decode_shape` — PROVEN, and the *only* piece
  actually established in this build: Sail-executable words land in
  `SupportedDecodeShape`.
* `skeletal_root_completeness` — proves `CoverageAssumptions → EventualCompleteness`.
  The ZisK content is carried entirely by the assumptions; the lone proven step is
  the Sail→shape bridge. (Named *skeletal* because it is exactly that: a frame with
  the real ZisK obligations left as holes.)

So the gap between today and the unconditional theorem is *exactly* the fields of
`CoverageAssumptions`: discharge them (against ZisK's real surface, via the Aeneas
bridge) and `skeletal_root_completeness` yields `EventualCompleteness` outright.

## Tracking issues (the plan to make this unconditional)

* eth-act/zisk-fv#111 — connect the real Aeneas-extracted decoder/lowering
  in-build; the decode side of Aeneas trust. Discharges the `decoderAcceptsInShape`
  and `loweringTotal` fields of `CoverageAssumptions`.
* eth-act/zisk-fv#108 — extend the Aeneas extraction to ZisK table data + witness
  builders. Backs the `rowTotal` / `opcodeTotal` / `soundnessContract` fields.
* eth-act/zisk-fv#74 — instantiate the theorem on a real ZisK execution trace
  (end-to-end integration witness): produces a concrete `OutstandingZiskPredicates` to feed here.
* eth-act/zisk-fv#77 — differentially test the Sail-Lean spec against the
  reference emulator; trust in the Sail side the proven bridge rests on.
* eth-act/zisk-fv#75 — eliminate `native_decide` / kernel-only axiom closure; the
  proven Sail→shape bridge currently evaluates via `native_decide`.
* eth-act/zisk-fv#78 — independent re-checking of the proof with an external kernel
  (lean4lean).

Everything here is an *acceptance/coverage* claim (ZisK does not reject what Sail
accepts), NOT a correctness claim (correctness is the soundness axis,
`ZiskFv.Compliance`). The abstract `Rv.Interface` route under
`ZiskFv/Completeness/Aspirational/` is quarantined and unused here.

/-- The Sail-side containment bridge (PROVEN, unconditional).

Every Sail-executable RV64IM word has a bit-layout inside the
`SupportedDecodeShape` enumeration, proven by evaluating the real generated Sail
decoder/encoder (`LeanRV64D.Functions.ext_decode` / `encdec_forwards`).

* `state` / `raw` — a Sail machine state (the decoder consults extension state)
  and the 32-bit word.
* premise `IsaExtensionsEnabled state` — `state` has `M` enabled, `Zmmul`
  disabled.
* premise `SailRv64imExecutableRawIn state raw` — `raw` round-trips through Sail
  to one of the eleven enumerated RV64IM instruction classes.
* conclusion `SupportedDecodeShape raw` — `raw` matches one of the seven shape
  families.

The proof evaluates the Sail functions via `native_decide`-style reduction
(eth-act/zisk-fv#75 tracks removing `native_decide`; eth-act/zisk-fv#77 tracks
validating the Sail spec itself against the reference emulator).

Caveat: `SupportedDecodeShape` is a hand-written predicate (`Rv64im/Shapes.lean`),
NOT ZisK's decoder — this says nothing about ZisK. -/

/-- **THE GOAL.** Every Sail-executable RV64IM word (in an RV64IM-enabled state),
outside ZisK's known decode gaps, is fully covered by ZisK. This is the eventual
*unconditional* completeness theorem; `skeletal_root_completeness` delivers it once
the `CoverageAssumptions` are discharged. A concrete `z` plus discharged
assumptions — the end-to-end instantiation tracked in eth-act/zisk-fv#74 — makes
this hold outright. -/

/-- **WHAT WE CURRENTLY ASSUME.** The per-stage coverage facts about ZisK's real
surface, to be discharged by the Aeneas extraction harness. Each field is one
item on the plan; discharging all of them closes the gap to
`EventualCompleteness`. Discharge is tracked by eth-act/zisk-fv#111 (decode side:
`decoderAcceptsInShape`, `loweringTotal`) and eth-act/zisk-fv#108 (table/witness
data: `rowTotal`, `opcodeTotal`, `soundnessContract`). -/

/-- Completeness skeleton: `CoverageAssumptions → EventualCompleteness`.

Blueprint reading: GIVEN an RV64IM-enabled Sail `state`, ZisK's (abstract)
surface `z`, and the coverage `assumptions` about it, THEN every Sail-executable
RV64IM word outside the known gaps is covered by ZisK.

The lone step proven outright is the Sail→shape bridge
(`sail_executable_within_supported_decode_shape`); all ZisK content is carried by
`assumptions`. Discharge `assumptions` (eth-act/zisk-fv#111 + eth-act/zisk-fv#108,
on a concrete `z` from eth-act/zisk-fv#74) and this is `EventualCompleteness
state z` unconditionally.

* `state` — the Sail machine state decoding is evaluated against.
* `sailIsa` — evidence `state` is RV64IM-configured (`M` on, `Zmmul` off).
* `z` — the ZisK surface (the abstract predicates).
* `assumptions` — the per-stage coverage facts about `z` (the plan items). -/
