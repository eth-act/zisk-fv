**Goldilocks FGL ↔ ℕ no-wrap toolkit.**

Factors the recurring tactical chain: cast both sides of an FGL
equation into `((nat : ℕ) : FGL)` form via `push_cast; ring`, lift to
`Fin GL_prime` via `congr_arg Fin.val`, strip the `% GL_prime` via
`Fin.val_natCast`, and close by `omega` under per-side `< GL_prime`
bounds.

**Scope:** additive packings only — 2 × 32-bit lanes (Main / bus
entry layout) and 4 × 16-bit chunks (Arith / BinaryAdd layout).
Multiplicative no-wrap (FGL identities like `a*b = c + d * 2^64`
where the operand product can exceed `GL_prime`) and signed
`BitVec.toInt` reductions are explicitly out of scope; both require
chunk-level carry-chain reasoning that doesn't factor through a
single packed-`.val` lemma.

The example at the bottom of the file demonstrates the canonical
5-line template (`push_cast; ring` casts, `rw`, `fgl_eq_to_nat_eq`,
omega).

/-! ## Core no-wrap lift -/

/-- **The no-wrap lift.** Given two ℕ values whose `((·:ℕ):FGL)`
casts are equal in `FGL`, and both are below `GL_prime`, conclude
they're equal in ℕ.

Once a caller has pushed an FGL equation through `push_cast; ring`
into `((lhs:ℕ):FGL) = ((rhs:ℕ):FGL)`, this lemma closes the lift to
`lhs = rhs : ℕ` provided per-side range bounds. -/

/-! ## Packed-form Nat-cast helpers

These are `push_cast; ring` factored as named rewrites. Each takes a
specific packing arity and exposes the natCast form a caller needs to
hand to `fgl_eq_to_nat_eq`. -/

/-- **2-lane (32-bit) FGL packing as a Nat-cast.** The standard
packing of two 32-bit lanes into a 64-bit operand on Main / on
operation-bus entries:

```
  l₀ + l₁ * 2³² = ((l₀.val + l₁.val * 2³² : ℕ) : FGL)
```

Trivial via `push_cast; ring`; named so callers can `rw` against it. -/

/-! ## Worked example — toolkit usability check

Demonstrates the 5-line template:

  1. Get an FGL equation `f_lhs = f_rhs` from the circuit.
  2. Use a `*_natCast` helper to cast `f_lhs` into `((nat_lhs : ℕ) : FGL)`.
  3. Same for `f_rhs`.
  4. `rw` both into the FGL equation.
  5. Close via `fgl_eq_to_nat_eq` with per-side bounds. -/

/-- **Toolkit usability test.** Given an FGL equation between two
specific 2/3-term sums plus per-term range bounds, derive the
corresponding ℕ equality. -/
